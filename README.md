# money-track
A simple app which helps keep track of purchases.

In order to be able to use the project, you will need:

1. Scala for the backend project       => https://www.scala-lang.org/download/
2. Sbt - Scala package management      => https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
3. Mongo for the database storage      => https://www.mongodb.com
4. Haskell for the command line parser => https://www.haskell.org/platform/
5. cabal - Haskell package manager     => http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Cabal

The Haskell command line parser does require a few dependencies.
